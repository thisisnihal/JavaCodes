/*
üîÅ Methods go with the object (runtime),
üì¶ Variables go with the reference (compile time)

Core Concept: Reference Type vs. Object Type
Think of it like this:
Reference type = What Java thinks the object is at compile time
Object type = What the object actually is at runtime
Easy Analogy: TV Remote and TV
Reference = Remote control (what buttons it has)
Object = Actual TV (what it can do)
You can point a basic remote (Parent) at a smart TV (Child), but you'll only have access to the buttons the remote knows about.
