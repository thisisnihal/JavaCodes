The most commonly referred to are the **23 "Gang of Four" (GoF) design patterns**, categorized into three main types:

---

## 🏗️ **Creational Patterns**

These deal with **object creation** mechanisms:

1. **Singleton** – Ensure a class has only one instance.
2. **Factory Method** – Create objects via a factory, not `new`.
3. **Abstract Factory** – Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
4. **Builder** – Construct complex objects step by step.
5. **Prototype** – Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.

## 🧩 **Structural Patterns**

These deal with **object composition** and relationships:

6. **Adapter** – Convert one interface to another.
7. **Bridge** – Separate abstraction from implementation.
8. **Composite** – Treat individual objects and composites uniformly.
9. **Decorator** – Add behavior to objects dynamically.
10. **Facade** – Simplify a subsystem with a unified interface.
11. **Flyweight** – Use shared objects to support many fine-grained objects efficiently.
12. **Proxy** – Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

---

## 🔁 **Behavioral Patterns**

These focus on **communication between objects**:

13. **Chain of Responsibility** – Pass requests along a chain until handled.
14. **Command** – Encapsulate a request as an object.
15. **Interpreter** – Interpret a language grammar or expression.
16. **Iterator** – Access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.
17. **Mediator** – Define an object that coordinates interactions between others.
18. **Memento** – Capture and restore an object’s internal state.
19. **Observer** – Notify dependents automatically when a subject changes.
20. **State** – Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
21. **Strategy** – Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
22. **Template Method** – Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method.
23. **Visitor** – Add operations to objects without changing them.

## 📌 Other Notable Patterns (Non-GoF)

These are widely used in real-world systems but not part of the original GoF list:

* **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** – Architecture pattern for separating concerns.
* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** – Variant of MVC popular in UI frameworks.
* **Repository Pattern** – Abstraction over data access.
* **Unit of Work** – Manages transactions and changes in a business context.
* **Service Locator** – Provide dependencies using a central registry (considered an anti-pattern by some).
* **Dependency Injection** – Externalize object creation to promote loose coupling.
